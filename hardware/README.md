## Welcome to the Hardware folder!

Here you will find a list of hardware components that I will be using to build the power electronics side of this project.

I’ll do my best to also include prices and website links where you may be able to buy these components.

For more information about wiring and the electronics setup, please see the `/electronics` section.

**NOTE:** I’m fortunate enough not to be buying these components myself, since I know they can be quite expensive for a home project. In the future, I may also suggest cheaper alternatives to at least get something going. :)
